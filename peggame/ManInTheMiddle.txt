pegExists(Location) {
    return a boolean if a peg already exists on the loaction parameter
    This will allow the peg to make the move there
}

locationExists(Location) {
    returns a boolean if location's (row > 0 AND row < max_row) OR (col > 0 AND col < max_col)
}

    checks if pegExists and if locationExists

    String moveMade

    verticle
    from is equal to the current location of the peg
    to is equal to the current location's row + 2 or - 2
    moveMade is equal to "Verticle"

    horizontal
    from is equal to the current location of the peg
    to is equal to the current location's col + 2 or - 2
    moveMde is equal to "Horizontal"

    from is equal to the current location of the peg
    to is equal to the current location's col + 2 and row + 2

    return the peg in the middle
    row-1 or row+1 if moveMade verticle
    col-1 or col+1 if moveMade is Horizontal
    both if moveMade is diagonal
