Horizontal:
    if from's col -2 is equal to to's col, or from's col +2 is equals to to's col
        it's Horizontal
        if from's col -2 is equal to to's col  
            get the x-coordinate at from's col - 1
        otherwise
            get the x-coordinate at from's col + 1

Verticle:
    if from's row -2 is equal to to's row, or from's row +2 is equal to to's row
        it's vertical
        if from's row -2 is equal to to's row  
            get the y-coordinate at from's row - 1
        otherwise
            get the y-coordinate at from's row + 1

Diagonal: 
    if it's both horizontal and verticle
        it's diagonal

get the location at the x and y corrdinate
